	"Ah...I was hoping you'd come meet with me. Sorry about the trouble getting here; I'm sure that you understand my need for...discretion.",
	"Ms. Charnock sent me. Said you had a proposition of some sort?",
	"Indeed I do. You're a very talented smuggler, Netalia. My agents have been monitoring the activities of the city's underground, and I understand that smugglers - good ones, at least - are a valuable commodity.",
	"Guess that must mean my name came up a lot.",
	"Correct. Your track record is impeccable. Where others have been caught or killed by security forces, you've managed to survive.",
	"Surviving is what I do best.",
	"But it does not need to be the only thing that you do. You live in the Undercity, don't you?",
	"...",
	"How is your life there? Comfortable? Stable?",
	"I manage.",
	"Wouldn't you rather live, instead of just...surviving?",
	"With all due respect, that's never really been an option for someone like me.",
	"Well, it is now. I'm prepared to pay you enough credits so that you will never have to smuggle again. If you do this last job for me.",
	"...",
	"I'm listening.",
	"Scattered across the city, there are eight government buildings that secretly house a specialized datachip in each. I need you to steal all of them for me.",
	"Government buildings? I've never broken into those before, mostly just warehouses and minor facilities. Won't security be extremely tight?",
	"Undoubtedly. But I believe that someone of your caliber of skill is more than capable of handling it."
