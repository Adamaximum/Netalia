	"Hello, Talia.",

	"Doing well, I hope?",
	"Splendid. If you don't mind, though, I'd like you to tell me about the job you got for me. Rent is due soon.",
	"Straight to business, alright. This job requires you travel to the Sewerworks Processing Facility. There, you will meet with two operatives who will each give you a softkey.",
	"Sewerworks? Ugh, this job better pay well, Mathias.",
	"I'm sure it will. After you obtain the two softkeys, proceed to the Commerce District. You'll hand the keys over to a contact, and they will compensate you.",
	"Meet operatives in Sewerworks, get keys, meet contact in Commerce, get paid. Got it.",
	"Be careful, Talia. Sewerworks has installed some light automated security within the facility.",
	"Don't worry about me, Mathias. I can handle a few bots. I'll return after I've got my money."
